## 1. Layer Structure
  * Layers are the first level of organisational hierarchy in Feature-Sliced Design
  * Their purpose is to separate code based on how much responsibility it needs and how many other modules in the app it depends on.
  * There are 6 layers in total, arranged from most responsibility and dependency to least:

### 1-1. App Layer
  * Role
    - The App Layer is the highest level of the Feature-Sliced Design architecture.
    - It handles application initialization, bootstrapping, and global configuration.
    - Contains everything required to run the application.
  * Characteristics
    - Does not contain slices (unlike other layers)
    - Directly composed of segments
    - Has the highest level of responsibility and dependency
    - Can import from all other layers
    - Other layers cannot import from the App layer
  * Main Segments
    - providers: Global providers and context setup
    - styles: Global styling and theme configuration
    - routes: Application routing configuration
    - entry: Main entry points and initialization code
    - fonts: Global font loading and setup for consistent typography

### 1-2. Pages Layer
  * Role
    - Represents the top-level page views of the application that users directly interact with
  * Characteristics
    - Each page is its own slice (e.g., home, profile, article-read, settings)
    - Cannot reference other pages (cannot import code from other pages)
    - Can only import from layers below (widgets, features, entities, shared)
    - Combines widgets, features and other components to create complete pages
    - Typically contains routing configuration specific to that page
    - May include page-specific layouts, state management, and API interactions
  * Main Segments
    - ui: Page-specific components and layouts
    - api: Page-specific API requests
    - model: Page-specific state and business logic
    - lib: Helper functions and utilities specific to the page
    - config: configuration files and feature flags.

### 1-3. Widgets Layer
  * Role
    - Represents large, self-sufficient blocks of UI that can be reused across multiple pages
    - Provides complex composite components that deliver complete user interface functionality
    - Serves as containers for features and entities to create meaningful UI blocks
  * Characteristics
    - Each widget is its own slice (e.g., header, sidebar, product-card, user-profile)
    - Cannot reference other widgets (cannot import code from other widgets)
    - Can only import from layers below (features, entities, shared)
    - May act as layout containers or complex UI components with their own state
    - Should be extracted when UI blocks are reused across multiple pages or when pages have multiple large independent blocks
    - Can serve as router blocks in nested routing systems, similar to how Pages layer functions in flat routing
  * Main Segments
    - ui: Widget-specific components and layouts
    - api: Widget-specific API requests
    - model: Widget-specific state and business logic
    - lib: Helper functions and utilities specific to the widget
    - config: Configuration files and feature flags

### 1-4. Features Layer
  * Role
    - Represents the main user interactions and business processes in the application
    - Implements reusable functionality that users care about
    - Encapsulates business logic that often involves business entities
  * Characteristics
    - Each feature is its own slice (e.g., auth, comments, notifications, search)
    - Cannot reference other features (cannot import code from other features)
    - Can only import from layers below (entities, shared)
    - Should be extracted when functionality is reused across multiple pages
    - Should be carefully selected to not overwhelm newcomers (not everything needs to be a feature)
    - Helps newcomers quickly discover important areas of functionality
  * Main Segments
    - ui: Feature-specific UI components like forms and interactive elements
    - api: Feature-specific API calls and data handling
    - model: Feature-specific state, validation, and business logic
    - lib: Helper functions and utilities specific to the feature
    - config: Feature flags and configuration settings

### 1-5. Entities Layer
  * Role
    - Represents business entities and domain concepts from the real world
    - Contains the core business models that the application works with
    - Provides data structures and basic visualizations of business objects
  * Characteristics
    - Each entity is its own slice (e.g., user, product, post, comment)
    - Typically represents terms used by the business to describe the product
    - Contains data models, validation schemas, and basic UI representations
    - Can only import from the shared layer
    - May use @x notation for cross-entity relationships while maintaining slice isolation
    - UI components are primarily for consistent representation across the application
  * Main Segments
    - ui: Entity-specific UI components for consistent visual representation
    - api: Entity-specific API requests and data manipulation
    - model: Entity data structures, validation schemas, and business logic
    - lib: Helper functions and utilities specific to the entity
    - @x: Cross-entity imports for managing entity relationships

### 1-6. Shared Layer
  * Role
    - Forms the foundation for the rest of the application
    - Creates connections with the external world (backends, libraries, environment)
    - Provides reusable utilities and core functionality
    - Defines highly contained, focused internal libraries
  * Characteristics
    - Does not contain slices (unlike other middle layers)
    - Directly composed of segments like the App layer
    - Has the lowest level of responsibility and dependency
    - All files can reference and import from each other within the layer
    - Can be imported by all other layers
    - Doesn't depend on business domains or application specifics
  * Main Segments
    - api: API clients and request functions for backend endpoints
    - ui: Application's UI kit and basic components without business logic
    - lib: Focused internal libraries (e.g., for dates, colors, text manipulation)
    - config: Environment variables, global feature flags, and configuration
    - routes: Route constants and patterns for matching routes

## 2. Import rule on layers

### 2-1. Simple Summary: Code Import Rules

The core rules for importing code in FSD are:

1. **Downward Imports Only**: Always import code only from layers below your current layer.
2. **No Horizontal Imports**: Cannot import code from other slices within the same layer.
3. **Free Internal References**: Freely import code from within your own slice.
4. **App and Shared Exceptions**: These two layers don't have slices, and their segments can freely import from each other.

### 2-2. Detailed Explanation

#### 2-2-1. Layer Import Rules

Layers consist of slices - highly cohesive groups of modules. Dependencies between slices are regulated by the layer import rule:

* A module (file) in a slice can only import from slices located in layers strictly below it.
* For example, a file inside üìÅ `~/features/aaa` (`~/features/aaa/api/request.ts`) cannot import code from any file in üìÅ `~/features/bbb`, but can import from üìÅ `~/entities` and üìÅ `~/shared`. It can also import from other files within its own slice üìÅ `~/features/aaa` (e.g., `~/features/aaa/lib/cache.ts`).

#### 2-2-2. Special Exceptions: App and Shared Layers

App and Shared layers are exceptions to this rule:
* They function both as layers and as slices simultaneously.
* While slices typically partition code by business domain, Shared has no business domains, and App combines all business domains.
* In practice, this means that App and Shared layers are composed of segments, and these segments can import from each other freely.

#### 2-2-3. Import Path Conventions

* **Within the same slice**: Relative paths are preferred to maintain the cohesion and portability of the slice. Example: within the features/auth slice, use `import { validatePassword } from '../lib/validators'` rather than absolute paths.
* **From other layers**: Absolute paths are recommended when importing from other layers to make dependencies clear and explicit. Example: `import { User } from 'entities/user'`
* **From segments in App and Shared layers**: Either relative or absolute paths can be used based on team preference, but consistency should be maintained throughout the project.

#### 2-2-4. Import Order Conventions

When importing code from multiple layers, it is recommended to organize import statements in the following order to maintain readability and consistency:

* Arrange import statements from higher layers to lower layers (from specific to abstract).
* For example, in a file within the App layer, the import statements should be arranged as follows:
  ```javascript
  // 1. External libraries
  import axios from 'axios';
  
  // 2. FSD layers (top to bottom)
  // 2.1. widgets layer (just below App)
  import { Header } from 'widgets/header';
  
  // 2.2. features layer
  import { AuthForm } from 'features/auth';
  
  // 2.3. entities layer
  import { User } from 'entities/user';
  
  // 2.4. shared layer (lowest)
  import { Button } from 'shared/ui';
  import { ApiClient } from 'shared/api';
  
  // 3. Parent directory imports
  import { config } from '../config';
  
  // 4. Current directory imports
  import { utils } from './utils';
  ```

This ordering aligns with the official ESLint rules for Feature-Sliced Design and makes the code structure and dependencies more clear.

## 3. Public API Rules

Public API is a contract between a group of modules, like a slice, and the code that uses it. It also acts as a gate, only allowing access to certain objects.

### 3-1. Public API Implementation

In practice, it's usually implemented as an index file with re-exports:

```javascript
// pages/auth/index.js
export { LoginPage } from "./ui/LoginPage";
export { RegisterPage } from "./ui/RegisterPage";
```

### 3-2. Characteristics of a Good Public API

A good public API makes using and integrating a slice into other code convenient and reliable. It can be achieved by setting these three goals:

1. The rest of the application must be protected from structural changes to the slice, like a refactoring.
2. Significant changes in the behavior of the slice that break the previous expectations should cause changes in the public API.
3. Only the necessary parts of the slice should be exposed.

The last goal has important practical implications about not using wildcard re-exports:

```javascript
// Bad practice, features/comments/index.js
// ‚ùå BAD CODE BELOW, DON'T DO THIS
export * from "./ui/Comment";  // üëé don't try this at home
export * from "./model/comments";  // üí© this is bad practice
```

This hurts the discoverability of a slice and can accidentally expose module internals, making refactoring difficult.

### 3-3. Public API for Cross-imports

Cross-imports are a situation when one slice imports from another slice on the same layer. Usually that is prohibited by the import rule on layers, but often there are legitimate reasons to cross-import. For example, business entities often reference each other in the real world, and it's best to reflect these relationships in the code instead of working around them.

For this purpose, there's a special kind of public API, also known as the `@x` notation. If you have entities A and B, and entity B needs to import from entity A, then entity A can declare a separate public API just for entity B:

```
üìÇ entities
   üìÇ A
         üìÇ @x
                  üìÑ B.ts ‚Äî a special public API just for code inside entities/B/
         üìÑ index.ts ‚Äî the regular public API
```

Then the code inside `entities/B/` can import from `entities/A/@x/B`:

```javascript
import type { EntityA } from "entities/A/@x/B";
```

The notation `A/@x/B` is meant to be read as "A crossed with B".

> Try to keep cross-imports to a minimum, and **only use this notation on the Entities layer**, where eliminating cross-imports is often unreasonable.

### 3-4. Issues with Index Files

Index files like `index.js`, also known as barrel files, are the most common way to define a public API. They are easy to make, but they are known to cause problems with certain bundlers and frameworks:

#### 3-4-1. Circular Imports

Circular import is when two or more files import each other in a circle. These situations are often difficult for bundlers to deal with, and in some cases they might even lead to runtime errors that might be difficult to debug.

To prevent this issue, consider these two principles:
- When files are in the same slice, always use _relative_ imports and write the full import path
- When they are in different slices, always use _absolute_ imports, for example, with an alias

#### 3-4-2. Large Bundles and Broken Tree-shaking in Shared

Some bundlers might have a hard time tree-shaking (removing code that isn't imported) when you have an index file that re-exports everything.

Usually this isn't a problem for public APIs, but for `shared/ui` and `shared/lib`, it's recommended to have a separate index file for each component or library:

```
üìÇ shared/ui/
   üìÇ button
         üìÑ index.js
   üìÇ text-field
         üìÑ index.js
```

#### 3-4-3. No Real Protection Against Side-stepping the Public API

When you create an index file for a slice, you don't actually forbid anyone from not using it and importing directly.
**Be careful as IDE auto-imports may cause direct imports that violate the Public API rules.**
To catch these issues automatically, we recommend using Steiger, an architectural linter with a ruleset for Feature-Sliced Design.

#### 3-4-4. Worse Performance of Bundlers on Large Projects

Having a large amount of index files in a project can slow down the development server. There are several things you can do to tackle this issue:

1. Have separate index files for each component/library in `shared/ui` and `shared/lib` instead of one big one.
2. Avoid having index files in segments on layers that have slices.
3. If you have a very big project, there's a good chance that your application can be split into several big chunks. Each package can be a separate FSD root, with its own set of layers.
   - For example, in a monorepo setup, some packages might only have Shared and Entities layers, while others might only have Pages and App. Others might include their own small Shared layer, but still use the big Shared from another package too.
